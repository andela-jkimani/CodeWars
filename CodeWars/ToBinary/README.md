## Convert Integer to Binary

Converts integers to binary, as simple as that. You would be given an integer as an argument and you have to return its binary form.

Notes: negative numbers should be handled as two's complement; assume all numbers are integers stored using 4 bytes (or 32 bits) in any language.

Your output should ignore leading 0s.

For example:

```toBinary(3)=="11"
toBinary(-3)=="11111111111111111111111111111101"```
